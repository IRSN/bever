This is the package **bever** dedicated to **B**ayes **E**xtreme-**V**alue 

This package is still in its early stage of development

- The use of block maxima with blod duration differing from 1 is
not well tested.

- For now it is possible to draw the predictive curve on the same
graphics as the RL plot only for GEV models, not for Poisson-GP
models. The reason is that some analysis is still required for the
transformation of plotting positions in "Renext style" tu use them in
"block style".
